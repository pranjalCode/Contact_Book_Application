# Contact_Book_Application
A contact book application using Java, JSP servlet, and MySQL database would allow users to store and manage their contacts in a digital format. The application would have a user-friendly interface with various features to enhance the user experience.

The application would be built using Java programming language, which is a popular language for building web applications. JSP (JavaServer Pages) would be used to create dynamic web pages that can display data from the database. Servlets would be used to handle user requests and to interact with the database.

The MySQL database would be used to store contact information such as name, phone number, email address, and any other relevant details. The database would be accessed using SQL queries, which would be executed by the servlets to fetch, update or delete contact information as required.

The user interface of the application would include pages for creating, editing, and deleting contacts. The user can add a new contact by filling out a form with the relevant details, and the data would be stored in the database. The user can also edit existing contacts by selecting them from a list and modifying the information as necessary. The user can delete a contact by selecting it from the list and confirming the deletion.
